      <p>I am currently working as an R&D engineer with Expanse Medical, a medical device start-up/incubator in Pleasanton, CA. In this role, I am:
  			<ul>
  				<li>developing low-cost versions of existing medical products and</li>
  				<li>developing new technologies in the neuro and electrophysiology spaces.</li>
  			</ul>
  		</p>
    </div>
	
	
    <div>
      <p>I am also using my newfound post-undergraduate freedom to pursue independent studies in various fields,
        mostly through reading textbooks and completing my own projects following syllabi available online.
        In the last few months, I have worked through the following sources:</p>

        Computer Science:
  			<ul>
  				<li>Introduction to Computing Systems: From Bits and Gates to C and Beyond - Patt and Patel</li>
  				<li>Algorithm Design - Kleinberg and Tardos</li>
  				<li>Data Structures and Algorithms in Java - Goodrich</li>
				<li>Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science - Barak</li>
  			</ul>
        Math:
  			<ul>
				<li>Notes on Discrete Mathematics - Aspnes</li>
  				<li>The Book of Proof - Hammack</li>
  			</ul>
        Economics+Finance:
  			<ul>
  				<li>Princimples of Macroeconomics - Mankiw</li>
  				<li>Fundamentals of Corporate Finance - Ross et al.</li>
  			</ul>
        Religion:
  			<ul>
          <li>Muhammad: His Life based on the Earliest Sources - Lings</li>

	<div>
      <p>I previously worked for Insight Optics in Atlanta. In this role, I:
  			<ul>
  				<li>worked on adapting <a href="http://matthewalunbrown.com/papers/ijcv2007.pdf">panorama creation</a> and other computer vision algorithms for medical image processing,</li>
  				<li>developing tools for dataset creation and the continuous integration of new data into our models,</li>
  				<li>and designing a procedure for patient retinal imaging exams using a smartphone-based device.</li>
  			</ul>
  		</p>
    </div>
	
    <div>
      <p>I also previously worked in the Ethier lab at Georgia Tech. In this role, I:</p>
  			<ul>
  				<li>created datasets and <a href="https://github.com/ethier-lab/AxoNet">deep learning models</a> used to quantify optic nerve damage in experimental models of glaucoma,</li>
  				<li>created easy-to-use tools for non computer-savvy biologists to process image data, including an <a href="https://github.com/ethier-lab/AxoNet-fiji">imageJ plugin</a> for the above,</li>
  				<li>and contributed to software used for digital image correlation, an imaging-based method for mechanical strain analysis.</li>
  			</ul>
